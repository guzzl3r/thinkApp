# thinkApp
Hello, this is a simple application, you write something, and this is sent to a computer where it will remain there for you or someone else to read it (_if you want to make it public, I'm not google, don't worry_). You will be able to see what you have written on a web page soon.

The intention of this app is that you write something every day, whatever you want, a thought, idea, reflection, so it will be saved **FOREVER**. Maybe when you die someone will read your insignificant legacy.

You can create an executable of the application by executing the command `npm run dist`.

Good luck my new friend!
